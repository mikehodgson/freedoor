DLL files
=========

This archive contains these files:

ELECOM12.OS2                - EleCOM compiled to DLL (OS/2 format)
ELECOM12.W32                - EleCOM compiled to DLL (Win32 format)
ELECOM12.PAS                - Sourcefile to generate those DLL's
ELEDEF.PAS                  - DLL definition file
DLLEXAM.PAS                 - Example on how to use EleCOM as DLL's.

You have to rename the DLL files back to .DLL before you can use them.

If you want to use these files, feel free - you can use ELECOM12.PAS to
compile them yourselves (if you have the appropriate compilers available)
