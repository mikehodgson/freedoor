WHATSNEW
========

30 July 2000     : Initial DoRxEvent and DoTxEvent were set in true state
                   which could cause initial very high CPU usage.
18 June 2000     : Changed the way EleCOM calls it threaded functions, making
                   EleCOM useful for applications where more than one comport
                   has to be controlled at a time.
20 February 2000 : W32SNGL.PAS or WIN32COM.PAS now include WINDEF.FPC if
                   compiled with the FPC compiler. This include file redefines
                   (some) of the Win32 API calls to make sure they are the
                   correct calling format for us (= the same as with Delphi
                   and VirtualPascal)
09 September 1999: W32SNGL.PAS - Reduced the number of threads used by this
                   engine. This one works better on Win9x systems.
05 September 1999: TELNET.PAS added some extra error information to make sure
                   errors can be more easily diagnosed.
29 August 1999   : ELENORM.PAS - "Plain, vanilly" Pascal version you can use
                   as a wrapper around the OOP code.
